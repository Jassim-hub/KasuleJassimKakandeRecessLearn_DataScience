# Machine Learning
# Introduction to machine learning
# What is machine leearning?

# Application of machine learning
# 1.Image analysis
# 2.Speech recognition
# 3.Disease prediction
# 4.Stock market analysis
# 5.Fraud detection
# 6.Recommendation Systems

# Types of machine learning
# 1.Supervised Learning:--labelled dataset,structured
"""
Common algorithms in supervised learning
-Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Trees
-Support vector Machines(SVM)
-K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
-Random Forest(RF)


-Deep Learning(CNN)-image classification


"""
# 2.Unsupervised Learning:-unlabelled data,discovering hidden patterns,clusters,structures
"""
-K-mean cluatering
-Hierarchial clustering
-PCA
"""
# Model selection and validation

# 3.Semi supervised learning:Uses bothe Supervised and Unsupervised learning(i.e:Some data may be labelled and other data is unlabelled)
# 4.Reinforced learning -rewards

# Lets look M
